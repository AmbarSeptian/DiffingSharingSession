/// Implementation of Paul Heckel's Diff Algorithm

/// > To compare two files, it is usually convenient to take a line as the
/// > basic unit, although other units are possible, such as word, sentence,
/// > paragraph, or character. We approach the problem by finding
/// similarities until only differences remain. We make two observations:
///
/// Preliminary Observations
///
/// 1. If a line occurs only once in each file, then it must be the same line,
/// although it may have been moved.
///
/// We use this observation to locate unaltered lines that we subsequently
/// exclude from further treatment.
///
/// 2. If a line has been found to be unaltered, and the lines immediately
/// adjacent to it in both files are identical, then these lines must be
/// the same line. This information can be used to find blocks of unchanged
/// lines.
